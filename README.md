High-Performance Algorithm & Data Structure Library
This repository serves as my personal portfolio of optimized solutions to common and advanced algorithmic problems encountered on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces. The solutions are implemented in C++ and Python with a strong focus on achieving optimal time and space complexity.

Each solution is documented to explain the underlying logic and complexity analysis, demonstrating a deep, practical understanding of core computer science principles. This collection is a living project, continuously updated as part of my preparation for a career in software engineering.
